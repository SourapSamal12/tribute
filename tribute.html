                <h2>..MISSILE MAN OF INDIA..</h2>
                <p>
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was not only a great scientist with a beautiful mind, but also a great human being with exceptional thoughts and amazing ideas to change the way mankind thinks. The 'Missile man of India', sadly, is no more with us, but his teachings and ideas will remain alive throughout He is counted among the greatest scientists of the 21st century. Even more, he becomes the 11th president of India and served his country. He was the most valued person of the country as his contribution as a scientist and as a president is beyond compare 
                    He is my role model not because he has achieved great things in life and become the president of India. 
                     He had structured the indigenous objective entering controlled rocket (Guided Missiles). He is worldwide renowned as the ‘Rocket Man of India’ for his extraordinary work in space science.
                    Sir Abdul Kalam was a vegan and carefully followed discipline throughout his life.
